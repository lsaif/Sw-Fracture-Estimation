# SwFractureEstimation
based on Aguilera, 1995

Water Saturation in fracture is a long debatable issues. This notebook allows you to estimate the water saturation value in fracture using an equation based on "Naturally Fractured Reservoir" book by Roberto Aguilera 1995. The question is as follow

![equation](https://github.com/lsaif/SwFractureEstimation/blob/master/Swfeq.png)

Where Swf is water saturation in fracture, B is oil formation factor, miu o and miu w is oil viscosity and water viscosity respectively, WOR is water oil ratio.

The result, however, were plotted in time series as the production data which also having the same characteristic.
